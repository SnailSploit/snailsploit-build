## Introduction

Social engineering attacks continue to rank as some of the most effective and insidious tactics used by adversaries in today's digital landscape. With the emergence of AI-driven phishing, deepfake impersonations, and the increasing adoption of IoT devices, attackers now have access to a broader array of tools to exploit human vulnerabilities.

To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt a holistic approach to assessing and improving their defenses, with a particular emphasis on human factors. The **Social Engineering Testing (SET) Framework** is designed to simulate, test, and improve the resilience of employees and organizations against a wide range of social engineering tactics. Through automated attack simulations, real-time feedback, and continuous improvement cycles, organizations can enhance their preparedness and security awareness, ultimately fostering a culture of resilience.

## Overview of the SET Framework

### What is the SET Framework?

The SET Framework is a strategic methodology for assessing and addressing human vulnerabilities through simulated social engineering attacks. These attacks mimic real-world adversarial tactics, such as phishing, vishing, impersonation, and more recent threats driven by AI, such as deepfake-based impersonations and AI-generated phishing campaigns. By evaluating how employees respond to these threats, the SET Framework helps organizations generate actionable insights that directly inform improvements in security training and protocols.

### Core Components

<div className="component-grid">

**Scope Definition & Objective Setting**

The SET Framework begins with defining the scope of the simulation. This includes selecting specific departments, roles, and attack vectors to be tested. For example, high-risk areas like finance or human resources may be targeted for impersonation or spear-phishing tests, while broader groups might be exposed to generic phishing attacks. Setting clear objectives, such as improving awareness or reducing the click-through rate on phishing links, is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of subsequent interventions.

**Scenario Development & Customization**

Attack scenarios are designed based on the organization's specific risk profile and real-world threats. For instance, AI-driven spear-phishing emails can be tailored to simulate highly personalized attacks, whereas deepfake voice impersonations can target senior executives. Customizing these simulations ensures that the tests accurately reflect the evolving threat landscape and align with the organization's unique vulnerabilities.

**Automated Execution with AI Integration**

AI tools are employed to automate and scale the execution of various social engineering attacks. From simulating thousands of phishing emails to creating convincing deepfake impersonations, AI enables continuous and scalable testing. This integration also allows for adaptive attacks that can evolve in real time based on employee responses.

**Data Collection & Analysis**

Detailed metrics, such as how employees interacted with simulated attacks, are collected to assess vulnerabilities. For instance, metrics like the time-to-report (TTR) a suspicious email or the credential submission rate in phishing simulations can reveal critical weaknesses in employee awareness.

**Continuous Feedback, Reporting, & Improvement**

The SET Framework promotes continuous learning and improvement. Employees receive real-time feedback after simulations, helping them recognize mistakes and learn how to respond more effectively. Additionally, regular reports are generated to inform leadership of organizational progress, allowing for the iterative refinement of both testing scenarios and training programs.
