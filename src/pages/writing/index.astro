  intro="Security knowledge should be shared, not hoarded. This collection includes articles published in industry magazines, original analysis, and commentary on emerging threats. My writing bridges the gap between technical research and practical application—whether explaining AI security risks to executives or documenting attack techniques for fellow practitioners. Published work appears in Hakin9 Magazine, PenTest Magazine, and eForensics, covering topics from cloud weaponization to social engineering psychology. Everything here aims to make readers more effective at securing systems and understanding threats."
