const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How dangerous is prompt injection in production systems?",
    answer: "Extremely dangerous. Prompt injection can lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized actions, system compromise, and business logic bypass. As AI systems gain more tool access and autonomy, the impact of successful injection attacks increases dramatically."
  },
  {
    question: "Can prompt injection be fully prevented?",
    answer: "No current solution completely prevents prompt injection because AI models fundamentally cannot distinguish between instructions and data. Defense requires layered controls: input sanitization, output filtering, privilege restriction, and monitoring. The AATMF framework provides comprehensive control guidance."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Custom Instruction Backdoor?",
    answer: "A novel attack vector where malicious content injected into ChatGPT's Custom Instructions persists across all conversations. This transforms a user-controlled setting into a persistent backdoor that influences every interaction."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is MCP security important?",
    answer: "The Model Context Protocol enables AI agents to access external tools and data. Security vulnerabilities in MCP can allow attackers to hijack these capabilities, potentially leading to file system access, credential theft, or lateral movement through connected systems."

  heading="Prompt Injection Research"
  intro="Prompt injection is the SQL injection of the AI era—a fundamental vulnerability class that exploits how language models process input. This research explores both direct attacks that manipulate user prompts and indirect attacks that poison external data sources. Special focus is given to emerging vectors in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), where AI agents gain tool access that dramatically expands the attack surface. Understanding these techniques is essential for anyone building or deploying AI systems, as prompt injection vulnerabilities can cascade into data breaches, unauthorized actions, and complete system compromise."
