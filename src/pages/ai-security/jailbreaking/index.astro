const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the difference between jailbreaking and prompt injection?",
    answer: "Jailbreaking manipulates the AI through conversational techniques without external data - it exploits the model's reasoning and role-play capabilities. Prompt injection inserts malicious instructions through user input or external sources. Jailbreaking is about psychological manipulation; injection is about input exploitation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can jailbreaks persist across sessions?",
    answer: "Yes, through context inheritance. When jailbroken conversation transcripts are pasted into new sessions or when systems lack proper context isolation, the compromised state can transfer. This is documented in our Context Inheritance Exploit research."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do AI safety measures fail against jailbreaks?",
    answer: "AI models are trained to be helpful and follow instructions. Jailbreaks exploit this by framing harmful requests in ways that appear benign or by gradually shifting context. The fundamental challenge is that models cannot reliably distinguish between legitimate creative requests and adversarial manipulation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is jailbreaking research ethical?",
    answer: "Responsible jailbreaking research improves AI safety by identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. All research here follows ethical guidelines: findings are disclosed responsibly, techniques are shared to help defenders, and no actual harmful content is produced."

  intro="Jailbreaking represents one of the most challenging problems in AI safety. Unlike technical exploits, jailbreaks work by manipulating how AI models reason, role-play, and follow instructions. This research documents novel attack techniques discovered through systematic testing—from context inheritance exploits that persist across sessions to memory poisoning attacks that corrupt AI judgment over time. The goal isn't to enable harm, but to understand these vulnerabilities deeply enough to build better defenses. Each technique here has been responsibly disclosed and is shared to advance the collective understanding of AI security."
