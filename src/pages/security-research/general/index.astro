    question: "Is this research applicable to production environments?",
    answer: "Yes. All techniques documented here have been tested against real-world configurations. However, always test in controlled environments first and ensure you have proper authorization before applying offensive techniques."
  },
  {
    question: "How does container security relate to AI security?",
    answer: "AI systems are increasingly deployed in containerized environments. Container escapes can compromise AI model weights, training data, and inference pipelines. Understanding both domains is essential for modern security."
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I learn more about these techniques?",
    answer: "Each article provides deep technical analysis with practical examples. For broader methodology, see the AATMF framework. For hands-on practice, build isolated lab environments to safely experiment."

  intro="Beyond AI-specific vulnerabilities, modern security requires deep understanding of infrastructure attack surfaces. This research covers container security, cloud exploitation, and endpoint evasion—domains where offensive knowledge directly improves defensive capabilities. Container escapes threaten cloud-native deployments, EDR evasion techniques reveal detection gaps, and cloud misconfigurations expose organizations to data breaches. Each article provides practical, tested techniques alongside defensive recommendations. The goal is to help security teams think like attackers while building stronger defenses."
