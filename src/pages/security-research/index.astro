  {
    question: "How do you discover these vulnerabilities?",
    answer: "Through systematic security research combining manual code review, automated scanning, and creative attack surface exploration. Each CVE represents significant research time following responsible disclosure practices."
  },
  {
    question: "Are these CVEs currently being exploited?",
    answer: "All disclosed CVEs have been responsibly reported and patched. We only publish details after vendors have released fixes and users have had reasonable time to update."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I protect my systems from these vulnerabilities?",
    answer: "Keep software updated, especially WordPress plugins. Subscribe to security advisories, implement Web Application Firewalls, and follow the specific remediation steps provided in each CVE disclosure."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer security testing services?",
    answer: "This research is shared for educational purposes and to improve overall security. For professional penetration testing services, contact through LinkedIn."

  intro="Security research is the foundation of effective defense. This hub contains original vulnerability discoveries, technical deep-dives, and practical attack analysis from years of penetration testing and security research. Every CVE disclosure here represents the complete lifecycle: discovery, responsible disclosure, vendor coordination, and public documentation. Beyond individual vulnerabilities, the general research covers systematic approaches to cloud security, container escapes, and endpoint evasion—knowledge that helps both offensive and defensive practitioners. All research follows responsible disclosure practices and aims to improve security for everyone."
