# SEO Strategy Specification - SnailSploit.com

## STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### Competitive Advantage
Kai Aizen occupies defensible SEO territory that corporate blogs cannot reach:
- **5x CVE credentials** → E-E-A-T authority signals
- **Original jailbreak research** → Content corporate blogs can't produce
- **Framework creator** → Terminology ownership for citation backlinks
- **Hands-on testing** → Technical depth over marketing fluff

### Target Audience
1. **Primary:** Security professionals researching AI vulnerabilities
2. **Secondary:** Enterprise buyers evaluating AI red team services
3. **Tertiary:** Developers implementing AI security controls

## KEYWORD STRATEGY BY PAGE

### Tier 1: First-Mover Opportunities (Zero/Low Competition)

| Target Keyword | Page | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| "MCP security hardening" | /ai-security/prompt-injection/mcp-* | No comprehensive content exists |
| "how to get a CVE for AI" | Future article | Massive gap, unique expertise |
| "context inheritance exploit" | /ai-security/jailbreaking/context-inheritance-exploit | Coined terminology |
| "AI memory poisoning attacks" | /ai-security/jailbreaking/memory-manipulation-attacks | Novel attack class |
| "custom instruction backdoor" | /ai-security/prompt-injection/custom-instruction-backdoor | Original discovery |

### Tier 2: Practitioner Credibility Required (Medium Competition)

| Target Keyword | Page | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| "LLM jailbreak walkthrough" | /ai-security/jailbreaking/* | Requires actual testing |
| "multi-turn jailbreak tutorial" | /ai-security/jailbreaking/* | Session expertise needed |
| "prompt injection CVE analysis" | /ai-security/prompt-injection/* | CVE credentials essential |
| "AI threat modeling framework" | /frameworks/aatmf | Brand ownership opportunity |
| "WordPress CVE researcher" | /security-research/cves | 5x CVE = instant credibility |

### Tier 3: Long-Tail Authority Building

| Target Keyword | Page | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| "ChatGPT jailbreak 2025" | /ai-security/jailbreaking/chatgpt-context-jailbreak | Model-specific traffic |
| "GPT context manipulation" | /ai-security/jailbreaking/context-inheritance-exploit | Technique-specific |
| "RAG security vulnerabilities" | /ai-security/rag-agentic-attack-surface | Emerging topic |
| "agentic AI attack surface" | /ai-security/rag-agentic-attack-surface | Growing search volume |
| "social engineering psychology framework" | /frameworks/sef | No dominant framework exists |

### Tier 4: Commercial Intent

| Target Keyword | Page | Rationale |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| "AI security assessment" | /about or /services (future) | Buyer research phase |
| "prompt injection testing expert" | /about | Niche specialization |
| "LLM red team consultant" | /about | Service positioning |

## CONTENT GAP OPPORTUNITIES

### High Priority - Create New Content

1. **"How to Get a CVE for AI Vulnerabilities"**
   - No practitioner content exists
   - Leverages 5x CVE credentials
   - High search intent from researchers

2. **"MCP Security Hardening Guide"**
   - First-mover opportunity
   - Builds on existing MCP articles
   - Zero comprehensive content exists

3. **"LLM Penetration Testing Methodology"**
   - High demand, weak existing content
   - Positions as expert practitioner
   - Ties to AATMF framework

4. **"Jailbreak Technique Taxonomy 2025"**
   - Classification requires experience
   - Citation magnet for researchers
   - Ties to P.R.O.M.P.T and AATMF

### Medium Priority - Expand Existing

1. Expand MCP articles into comprehensive guide
2. Add case studies to AATMF documentation
3. Create CVE technical deep-dives beyond basic info
4. Develop P.R.O.M.P.T practical examples
