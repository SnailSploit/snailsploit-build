# HOMEPAGE HERO COPY

## Implementation Guidelines for Claude Code

**File to modify:** `src/pages/index.astro` or `src/components/V3Hero.astro`

**Action:** Replace hero text content only. Preserve all structure, animations, layout.

**DO NOT TOUCH:**
- Meta tags, canonical, schema in frontmatter
- Layout wrapper or component imports  
- CSS classes or Tailwind styling
- Any `<head>` content

**Find and replace the text inside:**
- The main `<h1>` or headline element
- The supporting paragraph/tagline
- The credentials/byline element
- CTA button text (keep hrefs as specified below)

---

## Final Copy

**Headline (two lines):**
```
Social engineering and prompt injection are the same attack.
Different substrate.
```

**Supporting copy:**
```
I research the adversarial psychology that exploits both — and build frameworks to defend against it.
```

**Credentials line:**
```
Creator of AATMF • Author of Adversarial Minds • NVD Contributor
```

**CTA buttons:**
```
About Me → /about/
View Frameworks → /frameworks/
```

## Alternative Headline (optional)

```
LLMs have the same trust reflexes as humans.
They learned them from us.
```

Use same supporting copy and credentials.
